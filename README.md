# Calculator
A Real-Time Calculator using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
We need an UI and logical programming to handle the operations, where UI is a User Interface in which the user interacts with an application or a website. In this context by the interface we mean the things displayed in the output. They can include a display screen, buttons, input fields, etc.

Use of HTML:
In this program, we are using HTML to create content for the calculator UI, that means we are creating boxes, input fields, buttons, etc.

Use of CSS:
We are using CSS for managing the content of HTML like the content color, width, height, font size, padding, margin, etc.

Use of JavaScript:
In a calculator, it is established that there are different buttons and all these buttons have different functions. For example, the + button performs the addition operation, and â€“ performs the subtraction, and it is possible to assign these operations to these buttons using JavaScript.
